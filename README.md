Machine Learning Task: Video Classification 
Dataset Used: UCF101
Metrics Used: ‘accuracy’, ‘top_k_categorical_accuracy’
Methods used:
       1. Classify one frame at a time with a CNN 
       2. Use a time-distributed CNN, passing the features to an RNN, in one network    
       3. Use a 3D convolutional network   
       4. Extract features with a CNN, pass the sequence to a separate RNN  
       5. Extract features from each frame with a CNN and pass the sequence to an MLP
